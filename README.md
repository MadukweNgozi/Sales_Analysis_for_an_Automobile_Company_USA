## Data Modification
```Python
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df



# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 



# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()
```

## DATA ANALYSIS
#### DATA FILTERING
```Python
### Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

Is_US =   bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
Is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"
bike_in_US = bikes_df[(Is_US) & (Is_bike)]
bike_in_US.head()
```

#### Data Aggregation / Data Summary
```Python
#Aggregating the total profit by states in the United State for bike sales

Total_profit_by_states = bike_in_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum)
Total_profit_by_states
```
