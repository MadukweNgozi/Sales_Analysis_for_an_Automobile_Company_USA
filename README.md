## PROBLEM STATEMENT:  
What are the Top Most-Profitable 5 States for the Bike Product Category business in the United State ?

## DATA PRE-PROCESSING

#### DATA LOADING
##  Importing all the necessary python packages 
```Python

# Solution

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("The packages have been successfull imported")

```


```Python
# Reading the sales data into a pandas dataframe 

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Mazeliz Depot1/Desktop/NGOZI/_Mr Emma class/Data Set/bikes.csv")
bikes_df.head()    
```

## Data Modification
```Python
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df



# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 



# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()
```

## DATA ANALYSIS
#### DATA FILTERING
```Python
### Filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement

Is_US =   bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
Is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"
bike_in_US = bikes_df[(Is_US) & (Is_bike)]
bike_in_US.head()
```
#### Data Aggregation / Data Summary
```Python
#Aggregating the total profit by states in the United State for bike sales

Total_profit_by_states = bike_in_US.pivot_table(values = "Profit", index = "CustomerState", aggfunc = np.sum)
Total_profit_by_states
```

#### DATA SORTING
```Python
# Sorting the Aggregated data to rank the the result(state) according to the top most profitable state 

Total_profit_by_states.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False)
```
